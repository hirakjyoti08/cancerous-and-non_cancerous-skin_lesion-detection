# cancerous-and-non_cancerous-skin_lesion-detection

This was my ML Term project where we detected "Cancerous and non Cancerous skin lesion detection" 

The motivation for the project "Cancerous and Non-Cancerous Skin Lesion Detection using Machine Learning" stems from the need to improve the accuracy and efficiency of skin cancer diagnosis. Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide, and early detection plays a critical role in improving patient outcomes.

We had classified our dataset into 7 classes:

For the cancerous lesion - melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratoses and melanocytic nevi

For the non-cancerous lesion - Benign keratosis, vascular lesions, dermatofibroma

We used Resnet50 model and trained it according to our dataset and received training accuracy of 94.2% and for future improvements we can load the model in an application for realtime purposes.
